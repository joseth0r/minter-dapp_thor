Any transfer of Otherdeeds occurs through automated processes on the Ethereum blockchain,  which is not controlled in any capacity by Animoca. Transactions involving Otherdeeds may be irreversible, and, accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable. Some transactions of the Otherdeeds shall be deemed to be made when recorded on the Ethereum blockchain ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time that you initiated the transaction.\n\n- **(c)** There are risks associated with using an Internet based digital asset, including but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within your wallet. Animoca will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when effecting  transactions involving Otherdeeds, however caused, including any gas gees paid or payable in connection therewith. Animoca does not store your password, passkey, private key or other credentials needed to access the Otherdeeds following sale, and will not be able to recover such items if you should lose them.  You should keep a copy of your password, private key or passkey in a secure location.\n\n- **(d)** Transactions involving the Otherdeeds may rely on third-party platforms to perform transactions which are outside of Animoca\u2019s control.\n\nBy accessing and using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that you have sufficient understanding of the functionality, usage, storage, transmission mechanisms and other material characteristics of non-fungible cryptographic tokens, token wallets and other token storage mechanisms, public and private key management, blockchain technology, and blockchain-based software systems to understand these Terms.

Limitation of Liability.** \n\n- **(a)** TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NONE OF THE ANIMOCA PARTIES WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOST REVENUES, LOST SAVINGS, LOST BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, LOSS OF DATA OR GOODWILL, SERVICE INTERRUPTION, COMPUTER DAMAGE OR SYSTEM FAILURE, OR THE COST OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT ANY OF THE ANIMOCA PARTIES HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, EVEN IF A LIMITED REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.\n\n- **(b)** TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE ANIMOCA PARTIES\u2019 AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS, OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES, EXCEED ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS ($100).\n\n- **(c)** BY USING THE SERVICES, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE MATERIAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN ANIMOCA AND YOU.\n\n## **17. Governing Law.** These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of Hong Kong, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.\n\n## **18. Dispute Resolution.** Any dispute, controversy, difference, or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms, including the existence, validity, interpretation, performance, breach, or termination thereof, or any dispute regarding non-contractual obligations arising out of or relating to the Terms, shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration administered by the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre (\u201c**HKIAC**\u201d) under the HKIAC Administered Arbitration Rules in force when the notice of arbitration is submitted. The law of this arbitration clause shall be Hong Kong law. The seat of arbitration shall be Hong Kong. The number of arbitrators shall be one (1). The arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in English.\n\n## **19. General Terms.**\n\n- **(a) Reservation of Rights.** Animoca and its licensors exclusively own all right, title and interest in and to the Services, including all associated intellectual property rights.

Except where provided by applicable law in your jurisdiction, you may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Animoca\u2019s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms absent our consent or your statutory right, without such consent, will be null and void in its entirety. Animoca may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors, and any permitted assigns.\n\n- **(c) Notices.** Any notices or other communications provided by Animoca under these Terms will be given: (i) via email; or (ii) by posting to the Services. For notices made by email, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.\n\n- **(d) Waiver of Rights** Animoca\u2019s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Animoca. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.\n\n## **20.
