Limitation of Liability.**\n\n- **(a)** TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NEITHER YUGA LABS NOR ITS SERVICE PROVIDERS INVOLVED IN CREATING, PRODUCING, OR DELIVERING THE SITE WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOST REVENUES, LOST SAVINGS, LOST BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, LOSS OF DATA OR GOODWILL, SERVICE INTERRUPTION, COMPUTER DAMAGE OR SYSTEM FAILURE, OR THE COST OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SITE, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT YUGA LABS OR ITS SERVICE PROVIDERS HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, EVEN IF A LIMITED REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. \n\n- **(b)** TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL YUGA LABS\u2019 TOTAL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS, OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SITE, EXCEED ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS ($100).  \n\n- **(c)** BY USING THE SITE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE MATERIAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN YUGA LABS AND YOU.\n\n## **13. Governing Law and Forum Choice.** These Terms, and any action related thereto, will be governed by the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act, federal arbitration law, and the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in Section 14 \u201cDispute Resolution,\u201d the exclusive jurisdiction for all Disputes (defined below) will be the state and federal courts located in the State and City of New York, and you and Yuga Labs each waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.\n\n## **14. Dispute Resolution.**\n\n- **(a) Informal Dispute Resolution.** You and Yuga Labs must first attempt to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms, or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity thereof, or the use of the Site (collectively, \u201c**Disputes**\u201d) informally. Accordingly, neither you nor Yuga Labs may start a formal arbitration proceeding for at least sixty (60) days after one party notifies the other party of a claim in writing.  As part of this informal resolution process, you must deliver a written notice of any Dispute via first-class mail to us at Yuga Labs, 1450 S Dixie Hwy Ste 105 1075, Coral Gables, FL 33146.\n\n- **(b) Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes.** We each agree that any Dispute will be resolved **solely by binding, individual arbitration and not in a class, representative, or consolidated action or proceeding.** You and Yuga Labs agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these Terms, and that you and Yuga Labs are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms. \n\n- **(c) Exceptions.** As limited exceptions to Section 14(b) above: (i) we both may seek to resolve a Dispute in small claims court if it qualifies; and (ii) we each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights.\n\n- **(d) Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules.** The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (\u201c**AAA**\u201d) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the \u201c**AAA Rules**\u201d) then in effect, except as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules are available at [www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org) or by calling 1-800-778-7879. A party who wishes to start arbitration must submit a written Demand for Arbitration to AAA and give notice to the other party as specified in the AAA Rules. The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at [www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org). \n\n- Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) where you live, with provision to be made for remote appearances to the maximum extent permitted by the AAA Rules, unless we both agree to a different location. The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, and scope of this arbitration agreement.\n\n- **(e) Arbitration Costs.** Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules, and we will not seek to recover the administration and arbitrator fees we are responsible for paying, unless the arbitrator finds your Dispute is frivolous. If we prevail in arbitration, we will pay all of our attorneys\u2019 fees and costs and will not seek to recover them from you. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses to the extent provided under applicable law.\n \n- **(f) Injunctive and Declaratory Relief.** Except as provided in Section 14(c) above, the arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any claim asserted by either party and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party\u2019s individual claim. To the extent that you or we prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. The parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.\n\n- **(g) Class Action Waiver.** **YOU AND YUGA LABS AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING**. Further, if a Dispute is resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another person\u2019s claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution section shall be null and void.\n\n- **(h) Severability.** With the exception of any of the provisions in Section 14(g) of these Terms (\u201c**Class Action Waiver**\u201d), if an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction decides that any part of these Terms is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of these Terms will still apply.\n\n## **15. General Terms.**\n\n- **(a) Reservation of Rights.** Yuga Labs and its licensors exclusively own all right, title, and interest in and to the Site, including all associated intellectual property rights. You acknowledge that the Site is protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of the United States and foreign countries.

Yuga Labs may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors, and any permitted assigns.\n\n- **(c) Notices.** Any notices or other communications provided by Yuga Labs under these Terms will be given by posting to the Site. \n\n- **(d) Waiver of Rights.** Yuga Labs\u2019 failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Yuga Labs. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.\n\n## **16.
